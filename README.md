# Exploratory Data Analysis - Customer Loans in Finance

# Assignment
The task set by AiCore began with the scenario of myself working for a large financial institution, where managing loans is a critical component of business operations.

To ensure informed decisions are made about loan approvals and risk is efficiently managed, my task was to gain a comprehensive understanding of the loan portfolio data.

I showcased exploratory data analysis on the loan portfolio, using various statistical and data visualisation techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the loan data.

This information will enable the business to make more informed decisions about loan approvals, pricing, and risk management.

By conducting exploratory data analysis on the loan data, I would be able to gain a deeper understanding of the risk and return associated with the business' loans and, ultimately, improve the performance and profitability of the loan portfolio

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- Conversion of columns to the correct format
- Create a class to get information for the Dataframe
- Remove/impute missing values in the data
- Perform transformations on skewed columns
- Remove outliers from the data
- Dropping overly correlated columns

## Analysis and Visualisation
- Identify patterns and trends to inform how management could make more informed decisions about which loans are higher risk to the company.
